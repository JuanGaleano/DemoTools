#' Zelnik 11-term moving average. Adjusting for digit preference

#' @description  Zelnik method is used to adjust distributions by year of age for digit preference.This comes from 
#' Gray_1987_The Missing Ages: Adjusting for Digit Preference

#' @param Value numeric. A vector of demographic counts in single age groups.
#' @param q numeric. A vector with the linear operators for use in deriving unbiased estimates of single-age distributions
#' @param Age integer lower bound of age classes.

#' @details Single year age groups are assumed.

#' @return a named vector with the adjusted values
#' @export
